## Day 2: Upgrades and Core Mechanics

All in all it was a good day of development, I spent a couple hours in the morning; Took a break to meet Amy for lunch and then worked on it for the afternoon into the night were I had to eventually pull myself away. I got the following done:

* Updated Godot from 3.1.1 -> 3.2, this is related to a new `draw_arc` function in the newer version of Godot.
* Cleaned up and tiled my Sandbox area that I use for testing features.
* Made a little health and mana indicator and gave it a lil bob effect.
* Most importantly I fleshed out second chance mechanic.

### Sandbox 
Just a simple test area I tend to use a throw away scene purely for testing

### Health Bar
The health mechanic is reminisent of the Zedla Breath of the Wild Stamina meter, this is not a game I own or have played but non the less I can still appreciate the game dev wonder that is is.

### Second Chance Mechanic
The second chance mechanic is the center point of this whole games jam so I figured it would be best to get it started early so we can improve it going forward. So copying some of the work I did for the health bar I broke my idea down into its smallest possible components. That is a dynamically drawing shape generated by a series of points, a timer with a circluar countdown clock to illistrate the timer and the QTE button presses which would require some Keys, randomly generating them and placing them.

With the coming week being a busy one in work, unfortunitly I am not sure how much time I will have to work on it hence I am aiming low and so happy with my progress

## Day 3: Animations

This was a first short dev day so I focuesed on clean up and tweaking just to 

This being the first short day of dev I was interested in getting as much quality into the game in as small of a time as possible 

## Day 4: State Machines

## Day 5: AStar


## Day 6: Burnout and Stress
Got home from work, this being demo day I was working til around half 7, getting deadlines and attending remote demo via hangouts. Burn in began to set it with cooking, cleaning, working late and demo stress I didn't feel up to developing, the hope being I would be fresh for the final weekend.

Burn out set in so took the day off

## Day 7 - End of Jam: Pivot and Acceptance 
This was difficult for me to do but I decided halve way through Friday night I came to the realisation that to get the Jam done I would have to be flat out, this is something I am ofcourse used too but this weekend fell on possible the most important weekend of the year for me this was my Anniversary, 11 years to be specific. Amy is my favourite person my partner in crime and I wouldn't be half the man I am if it wasn't for her. So I prioritsed my personal life over the Jam.

It was a strange sense of calm that washed over me in the minutes after coming to this decision. I am quiet a driven person but I am the first to admit I am also tough on myself when it comes to dead lines I feel like if I dont hold myself accountable who will, if I am making excuses at the end then I didnt apply myself along the way. This is usually my down turn but I am enjoying the Jam and my game too much to rush and put up only 10% of what I wanted for the Jam so my descion is to drop the deadline of the Jam and continue to develop the game in my free time. I am going to give it a maximum of 3-4 weeks. Seeing what I can get done in a week I would love to take the foot off the gas and enjoy the ride alittle more. So hopefully some time in February there will be a `final` update for my Godot Wild Jam #17 entry.
