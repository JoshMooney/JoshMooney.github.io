There is nothing here Opps 

## Day 2

All in all it was a good day of development, I spent a couple hours in the morning; Took a break to meet Amy for lunch and then worked on it for the afternoon into the night were I had to eventually pull myself away. I got the following done:

* Updated Godot from 3.1.1 -> 3.2, this is related to a new `draw_arc` function in the newer version of Godot.
* Cleaned up and tiled my Sandbox area that I use for testing features.
* Made a little health and mana indicator and gave it a lil bob effect.
* Most importantly I fleshed out second chance mechanic.

### Sandbox 
Just a simple test area I tend to use a throw away scene purely for testing

### Health Bar
The health mechanic is reminisent of the Zedla Breath of the Wild Stamina meter, this is not a game I own or have played but non the less I can still appreciate the game dev wonder that is is.

### Second Chance Mechanic
The second chance mechanic is the center point of this whole games jam so I figured it would be best to get it started early so we can improve it going forward. So copying some of the work I did for the health bar I broke my idea down into its smallest possible components. That is a dynamically drawing shape generated by a series of points, a timer with a circluar countdown clock to illistrate the timer and the QTE button presses which would require some Keys, randomly generating them and placing them.

With the coming week being a busy one in work, unfortunitly I am not sure how much time I will have to work on it hence I am aiming low and so happy with my progress
