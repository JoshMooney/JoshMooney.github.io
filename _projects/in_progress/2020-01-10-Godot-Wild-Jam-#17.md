## End of Day 1 

I got a pretty good idea of the kind of game I want to make, I am aiming for a top down 2D dungeon crawler rouge like with a second chance mechanic that when you die a QTE mini game will pop up and give you the chance to revive yourself. This will be timed and will increase in difficultly the more it is used. I want to aim to get at least one of the wild cards done, I've my sights set on the incorperating coop multiplayer into the game. So today was mostly planning and hashing out my idea. 

I did however get a few good starting point tasks done that being setting up a Trello board with a list of all the mechanics I hope to implement and short checklist of features required for that mechanic. Set up the github repository, source control is vital less code needing to be rewritten or copyed to and from USB drives the better. Also something I have never done this early into development of a game I went searching for game art, I wanted to get a feel for what was out there and what kind of atmosphere I can achieve using free assets after all I am cheap and the internet has near endless amounts of resources that can be scoured

## Day 2

All in all it was a good day of development, I spent a couple hours in the morning; Took a break to meet Amy for lunch and then worked on it for the afternoon into the night were I had to eventually pull myself away. I got the following done:

* Updated Godot from 3.1.1 -> 3.2, this is related to a new `draw_arc` function in the newer version of Godot.
* Cleaned up and tiled my Sandbox area that I use for testing features.
* Made a little health and mana indicator and gave it a lil bob effect.
* Most importantly I fleshed out second chance mechanic.

### Sandbox 
Just a simple test area I tend to use a throw away scene purely for testing

### Health Bar
The health mechanic is reminisent of the Zedla Breath of the Wild Stamina meter, this is not a game I own or have played but non the less I can still appreciate the game dev wonder that is is.

### Second Chance Mechanic
The second chance mechanic is the center point of this whole games jam so I figured it would be best to get it started early so we can improve it going forward. So copying some of the work I did for the health bar I broke my idea down into its smallest possible components. That is a dynamically drawing shape generated by a series of points, a timer with a circluar countdown clock to illistrate the timer and the QTE button presses which would require some Keys, randomly generating them and placing them.

With the coming week being a busy one in work, unfortunitly I am not sure how much time I will have to work on it hence I am aiming low and so happy with my progress
